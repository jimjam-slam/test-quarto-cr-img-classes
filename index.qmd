Oh hello! Here are some images with classes:

::::{.column-screen}

This text is inside the section. But the section itself doesn't seem to get `.column-screen`...

:::{#working}
This works: ![a caption](trees.png)
:::

This also works (no caption):

:::{#alsoworking}
![](trees.png)
:::

But this doesn't:

:::{#notworking}
![This one is breaks things](trees.png)
:::

::::
